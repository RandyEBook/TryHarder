<h2>3. AML/KYC Procedure</h2>

<h2>5. Prices, Exchange Rates and Confirmations</h2>
<p>5.1. Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets are highly experimental and risky.</p>
<p>5.2. ChangeNOW’s conversion service attempts to provide accurate price and exchange rate information, but this information is highly volatile and can change quickly without Users necessarily being aware of these changes.</p>
<p>5.3. For normal orders, the exchange rate is calculated at the time your payment is accepted. It is important to note that a payment being broadcast to the blockchain network does not constitute an acceptance by ChangeNOW of that payment.</p>
<p>5.4. The ChangeNOW’s interest (the ChangeNOW’s remuneration for the using of its services and the Website) is included in the final rate of the User’s change transactions. You don’t need to pay additional fees directly to the ChangeNOW, unless otherwise provided by these Terms.</p>
<p>5.5. Please, contact the customer support (<a href="mailto:support@changenow.io">support@changenow.io</a>) for more information on exchange rates and prices.</p>
<p>5.6. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the changes you complete via the Website and our services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that ChangeNOW is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your exchanges or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any transactions.</p>
<h2>6. Returns and Refund Policy</h2>
<p>6.1. Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets are, by their nature, generally irreversible, and their exchange rates are highly volatile and transitory. We cannot be responsible for any risk in use of the Website, including but not limited to exchange rate risk and market risk. All sales and transactions after the ChangeNOW exchange are final and amount is non-refundable.</p>
<p>6.2. If an error occurs with a User’s exchange or interface on the User’s side of the transaction, the “Order Status” page on the Website will indicate whether or not the failed exchange will result in a refund of the User’s deposited Digital Asset or the outgoing Digital Asset to which the User was exchanging.</p>
<p>6.3. The Digital Asset deposited by the User can be refunded to the User if the “Order Status” page either:</p>
<ul>
<li>indicates the exchange failed by displaying “failed” message; or,</li>
<li>indicates the exchange got stuck in “Awaiting payment” or “Ready for exchange” stages.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rules outlined above do not apply to the cases when the deposits have already been exchanged.</p>
<p>6.4. The outgoing Digital Asset will be sent to the User if the “Order Status” page indicates a successful exchange by displaying “Sent to your wallet” or “Completed”.</p>
<p>6.5. ChangeNOW handle requests from the Users on a case-by-case basis. Any decisions by ChangeNOW with respect to refunds or exchanges are final.</p>
<p>6.6. In case of a positive decision, the Digital Asset will be sent either to the initial address used for the transaction or to the specified refund address.</p>
<p>6.6.1 If a User does not specify the refund address, the Digital Asset will be sent only to the initial transaction address.</p>
<p>6.6.2 In case the transaction was made on a partner’s platform(any other website, application, service, etc. other than ChangeNOW), ChangeNOW is not responsible for the refund procedure. Should this happen, a User must apply for the refund on the partner’s platform where the transaction was made.</p>
<p>6.6.3 In case the Users need to receive the refund to the address different from the initial address and the specified refund address (for the transaction made on <a href="https://changenow.io/">www.changeNOW.io </a>or ChangeNOW app), they should file an application to ChangeNOW support service (<a href="mailto:support@changenow.io">support@changenow.io</a>) and undergo the verification procedure.</p>
<p>6.7. Please, note:</p>
<ul>
<li>All transactions from ChangeNOW to the User’s outgoing Digital Asset wallet shall be subject to all posted fees, including but not limited to miner fees.</li>
<li>The Digital Assets extraction process can take up to twenty (20) business days. If the User wishes to expedite this process, additional charges may apply.</li>
<li>Unsupported Digital Assets that are deposited into our system to unrelated wallets cannot be extracted or returned. ChangeNOW reserves the right to handle this on a case-by-case basis. Any decisions by ChangeNOW with respect to such Digital Assets being deposited when no longer supported are final.</li>
<li>Transactions below the minimum limits determined on the Website can not be completed.</li>
<li>When the User provides a destination address, this is the only address that output funds can be sent to. Any decisions by ChangeNOW with respect to refunds in these circumstances are final.</li>
<li>ChangeNOW only accepts one (1) deposit per transaction ID (TXID). If your funds are deposited in a TXID with more than one (1) deposit, you will need to contact support to receive a refund. The exchange rate will not be honored and your exchange cannot be completed.</li>
<li>WARNING: There are fake websites pretending to be ChangeNOW’s Website (aka “phishing scams”). They use a misspelled URL that looks like “changenow.io” in order to trick the Users into sending them funds. DO NOT USE ANY SERVICE THAT ISN&#8217;T EXACTLY LOCATED AT THE DOMAIN: “ChangeNOW.io”.</li>
</ul>
<p>ChangeNOW is not responsible for funds that have been sent to these fake phishing sites. It is important that all Users shall verify they are visiting the correct URL (<a href="https://changenow.io/">ChangeNOW.io</a>) on their own and search for the security certificate in the URL bar of their browser.</p>
<p>Also, never trust private messages, solicitations or requests for funds from people claiming to be ChangeNOW unless you have verified that it is an official request from a ChangeNOW’s employee.</p>
<p>In case of doubt, contact us directly to verify any messaging. Stay diligent &#8211; and please report any phishing scams to our team (<a href="mailto:support@changenow.io">support@changenow.io</a>).</p>
<p>6.8. If there are dramatic changes in the cryptocurrency market, ChangeNOW can not exchange Cryptocurrency on the fixed rate. In this case ChangeNOW shall carry out exchange transactions at the market rate or return the Cryptocurrency to the User at the choice of the latter.<br>The Parties agree that under “dramatic changes in the cryptocurrency market” they understand the changes in the cryptocurrency rates equal to 3% or higher in any direction.</p>
<p>6.9. If there are any changes in the cryptocurrency market and the User decided to take any advantages of the Website&#8217;s vulnerability, ChangeNOW can not complete the exchange transactions of such User and shall return him or her the Cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>7. Indemnification</h2>
<p>7.1. You agree to hold harmless and indemnify ChangeNOW from and against any third party claim arising from or in any way related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>your breach of the Terms;</li>
<li>your violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with the Website and our services,</li>
</ul>
<p>including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs of every kind and nature.</p>
<p>7.2.
